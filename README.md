Although this is a free game on the iOS App Store, I thought it would be a nice gesture to the community if I open sourced the code I used to make the game.

This game does include some lesser known topics such as shape recognition when a user draws on the screen. Feel free to look through the code for inspiration, assistance, etc. You can check [my projects page](http://liamrahav.me/projects) for more information about this app, as well as other projects I have done in the past.

This game would not be possible if I did not have access to amazing DRM/Copyright-free sprites and audio. You can find which artist provided what asset in the ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.md file. Any assets, sprite or audio, that is not mentioned in the acknowledgement file is made by myself or people who have given me permission to use their work without credit, as well as to open source their work. 

For this reason, **all assets used are free for use** by anyone. However, you **must** acknowledge all authors for the assets you are using that are within the ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.md. Any asset you use that has no mentioned author is made by me, Liam Rahav, and acknowledgement must be given for these assets as well. These assets all fall under the same **Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Public License**.

Sorry for all the legal talk, but it's necessary when open sourcing an application on the market. It is important to not that you **cannot, under any circumstance, introduce a free version of this application to the app store** If you have any questions feel free to send me a message. If you see any issues in the code, feel free to open up an issue. And, most importantly, feel to clone or branch this repo and see what you can do with the app. 

Also a quick note, I have a file called Keys.swift that I have ignored with all my API keys and such, so if you are implementing something similar it is important to keep that in mind.

##Enjoy!
