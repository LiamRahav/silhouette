Although this is a free game on the iOS App Store, I thought it would be a nice gesture to the community if I open sourced the code I used to make the game.

This game does include some lesser known topics such as shape recognition when a user draws on the screen. Feel free to look through the code for inspiration, assistance, etc. You can check [my website](http://liamrahav.me/) for more information about this app, as well as other projects I have done in the past.

This game would not be possible if I did not have access to amazing DRM/Copyright-free sprites and audio. You can find which artist provided what asset in the ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.md file. Any assets, sprite or audio, that is not mentioned in the acknowledgement file is made by myself or people who have given me permission to use their work without credit, as well as to open source their work.
